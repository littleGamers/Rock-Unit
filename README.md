## Rock-on &amp; Bomb-off

 The evil terrorists planted bombs all over the city.
 
 The bombs are wired with 6 wire which represents guitar strings. Your job is to play the notes of your favorite rock songs to defuse the bombs.
 
 Lucky for you, you used to be a professional guitar player ;)
 
 ## Instructions:

Move with the UP and DOWN arrow keys.

Wait for a note to touch the player's icon and then play that note in the correct timing. Play the notes with the number keys (1-6).
